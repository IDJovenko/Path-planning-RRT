# Pathfinding algorithm RRT ( Rapidly exploring Random Tree)
## Description
  This public repository serves to showcase an interactive Windows OS application demonstrating the operation of the widely-used RRT (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree) pathfinding algorithm. The RRT algorithm is a popular method employed in robotics, motion planning, and autonomous navigation systems.


## Key Features:

* Interactive UI: The program offers a user-friendly graphical interface specifically designed for Windows OS. Users can interact with the application effortlessly, gaining insights into the process of RRT algorithm execution.

* Customizable Parameters: To facilitate experimentation and understanding, the application exposes various parameters that users can adjust. These parameters include the maximum number of iterations, the location and size of obstacles, the location of the points of the beginning and end of the path, the random seed and the number of tree nodes.
  
* Visual Feedback: The visualization module employs color-coded visual cues, allowing users to distinguish between the obstacles, the randomly sampled points, the tree nodes, and the final path. This visual feedback aids in comprehending the workings of the RRT algorithm effectively.
  
  Overall, this public GitHub repository offers an immersive interactive experience, helping users understand and visualize the RRT pathfinding algorithm's workings on Windows OS. By exploring the project and experimenting with the customizable parameters, users can enhance their understanding of motion planning algorithms while enjoying the engaging visualization.

_The program was developed in the Visual Studio environment._
